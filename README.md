# Solution to Adi's challenge

This repository contains a python solver for a little challenge set by a friend.

## The problem

For a pair of integers `base` and `multiplier`, find a number N whose 
decimal representation ends with the decimal representation of `base`,
and whose decimal representation, after multiplying by `multiplier` stars
with `base`

For example, for `base = 4` and `multiplier = 4`, the solution is 102654, because:
```
102654 * 4 = 410265
```

It seems to be broken for bases and multipliers above 9 :smile:

_or maybe it's just unsolvable..._
